# Dimeloper's NativeScript Demo App

I will be developing this app to apply my learnings throughout my NativeScript learning journey.

## NativeScript Notes

### Create NativeScript project

`tns create`

### Run on iOS

`tns run ios -bundle`

### Run on Android

`tns run android --bundle`

### Debug on iOS

`tns debug ios -bundle`

### Debug on Android

`tns debug android --bundle`

### Create NativeScript component

We can use the Angular CLI commands like: `ng g c componentName`, just make sure that @nativescript/schematics is installed globally.

To install: `yarn global add @nativescript/schematics`
